# Fetch Challenge
## Instructions
Please write a native iOS app that allows users to browse recipes using the following API: https://themealdb.com/api.php

1. There are 2 endpoints that your app should utilize:
    - https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert for fetching the list of meals in the Dessert category.
    - https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID for fetching the meal details by its ID.

2. The user should be shown the list of meals in the Dessert category, sorted alphabetically.

3. When the user selects a meal, they should be taken to a detailed view that includes:
    - Meal name
    - Instructions
    - Ingredients/measurements

4. Please read the following guidelines carefully before starting the coding
challenge:
    - Be sure to filter out any null or empty values from the API before displaying them.
    - UI/UX design is not what youâ€™re being evaluated on, but the app should be user friendly and should take basic app design principles into account.
    - Project should compile using the latest version of Xcode.

## Disclaimer
I have just started learning Swift this year as part of CodePath's online development course. As such, I am not too fluent in SwiftUI as I have been taught the basics with UI Kit. However, I wanted to try out Swift UI since it was preferred over UI Kit for this challenge and I wanted to challenge myself. As such, I followed many tutorials/Stack Overflow posts and tried to list most of the resources I have used below. 

I also understand that many of the coding approaches I used, such as when filtering out the null/empty values, are not the most foolproof or efficient methods. However, researching the most proper method to complete this challenge would take me a much longer time than I would have liked to spend on a take-home test. Hence, I solved most of the requirements as best as I could with my current knowledge of Swift/SwiftUI.
